Hackerrank
==========

All my hackerrank attempts.


Lights Out: The thanksgiving hackathon game. My strategy was to randomly choose the larget possible effect until the endgame (2 lights) where I used a bit of smarts to keep it from doing the obvious wrong move.

Scotch Bid: The level 2 scotch bidding game. Current strategy is to bid balance/distance until the end, unless the opponent is about it win, in which case I pull out all the stops to either try and win again or force a draw.

Conway's Game of Life: 2p version of the GOL. Interesting. Current strategy is to use a puffer along with two gliders and a methusela to out-last and out-generate the opponent. Plus leftovers are used to attack the opponent's structures.
